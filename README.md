# GPT-powered Table to $\LaTeX$ Converter

The purpose of this very simple Streamlit app is to allow users to convert small tables in .csv (the maximum number of tokens is a significant bottleneck) to $\LaTeX$ code. Behind the scenes a prompt is passed to GPT-3.5-turbo, after verifying that the table is not too long. 

Manually converting tables to $\LaTeX$ for reports can be a pain, so I hope you will find this app useful!
